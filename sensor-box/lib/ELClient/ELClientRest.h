// The ELClientRest class makes simple REST requests to a remote server. Each instance
// is used to communicate with one server and multiple instances can be created to make
// requests to multiple servers.
// The ELClientRest class does not support concurrent requests to the same server because
// only a single response can be recevied at a time and the responses of the two requests
// may arrive out of order.
// A major limitation of the REST class is that it does not store the response body. The
// response status is saved in the class instance, so after a request completes and before
// the next request is made a call to getResponse will return the status. However, only a pointer
// to the response body is saved, which means that if any other message arrives and is
// processed then the response body is overwritten by it. What this means is that if you
// need the response body you best use waitResponse or ensure that any call to ELClient::process
// is followed by a call to getResponse. Ideally someone improves this class to take a callback
// into the user's sketch?
// Another limitation is that the response body is 100 chars long at most, this is due to the
// limitation of the SLIP protocol buffer available.
